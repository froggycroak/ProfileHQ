The project involves designing a moon gate, which is a common element in Chinese gardens, for a small exhibition hall that showcases local agriculture. I am responsible for its panel design. The town mayor has requested that the panels of the moon gate depict representational patterns of swimming fish to reflect the local agricultural characteristics. To achieve this, a multi-agent system is used to represent the shoal of fish, with individuals in the system changing their positions, speeds, shapes and directions according to rules including distance, cohesion and alignment. The key step is to capture a moment when over 200 fish swim vividly around the doorway, which is then recorded as JSON files and transferred to DXF files for laser engraving machines. The panels are processed in a metalwork factory and assembled on the construction site.
The project shows the imitative ability of a MAS and the power of the workflow of automatically generating patterns and DXF files for laser engraving machines, which allows for facade variation without extensive manual drawing in AutoCAD.
