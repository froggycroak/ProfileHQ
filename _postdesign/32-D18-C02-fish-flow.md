本项目是一座农业科技展示馆的附带门洞设计，结合了中式园林常见的月拱门和锦鲤游曳的意象。我主要负责建筑施工图的绘制和月拱门面板设计工作。应镇长要求，面板需以具象化的游鱼图案为核心元素，以此呼应本地农业特色。为实现这一目标，项目采用多智能体系统模拟鱼群动态——系统中的每个个体会根据距离、聚集与对齐等规则，自主调整位置、速度、形态及游动方向。关键步骤在于捕捉超过200条鱼围绕门洞灵动游动的瞬间画面，将该动态场景转换为DXF格式文件供激光雕刻机使用。面板在金属加工厂完成加工，并在施工现场组装成型。项目展现了多智能体系统在模拟生物群体行为上的仿生能力，验证了“自动生成图案-DXF文件-激光雕刻”全流程的可行性.这一流程无需依赖AutoCAD手动绘图，即可实现立面图案的多样化定制，大幅提升了设计与生产的效率。

The project involves designing a moon gate, which is a common element in Chinese gardens, for a small exhibition hall that showcases local agriculture. I am responsible for its panel design. The town mayor has requested that the panels of the moon gate depict representational patterns of swimming fish to reflect the local agricultural characteristics. To achieve this, a multi-agent system is used to represent the shoal of fish, with individuals in the system changing their positions, speeds, shapes and directions according to rules including distance, cohesion and alignment. The key step is to capture a moment when over 200 fish swim vividly around the doorway, which is then recorded as JSON files and transferred to DXF files for laser engraving machines. The panels are processed in a metalwork factory and assembled on the construction site.
The project shows the imitative ability of a MAS and the power of the workflow of automatically generating patterns and DXF files for laser engraving machines, which allows for facade variation without extensive manual drawing in AutoCAD.
